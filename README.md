# CANDU Reactor Temperature Monitor Simulation

## üîé Introduction

Nuclear energy is one of the most powerful and fascinating technologies humans have ever developed. At the heart of this technology lies the **reactor core**, where the splitting of uranium atoms releases an immense amount of energy in the form of **heat**.

Canada is home to one of the most innovative nuclear reactor designs in the world: the **CANDU reactor** (CANada Deuterium Uranium). Unlike most reactors, the CANDU uses **natural uranium** as fuel and **heavy water (deuterium oxide)** as both moderator and coolant. This makes it highly efficient, flexible, and a cornerstone of clean electricity generation in Canada.

Imagine standing before this engineering marvel ‚Äî **a machine that controls the raw power of atomic fission** and turns it into clean, reliable electricity for millions of homes.

Our program brings a small piece of that excitement to life. While not a full reactor simulation, it models **heat transfer** inside a nuclear system, showing how **fuel temperature** and **coolant temperature** evolve over time. Even better, it visualizes the process through a live graph and a graphical user interface (GUI), giving you a window into the invisible but critical thermal dance happening inside a reactor.

## üéØ Purpose of the Program

The purpose of this program is to:

* Simulate **fuel and coolant temperature changes** in a simplified nuclear reactor model.
* Demonstrate how **heat is transferred** from the fuel rods to the coolant.
* Provide both a **live GUI visualization** with a background image and temperature readouts, and an **embedded graph** that plots the temperature changes dynamically.
* Make nuclear reactor concepts fun and interactive for students, engineers, or curious learners.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Physics Model**

   * The program models the **fuel** as a heat source (due to nuclear fission).
   * Heat is transferred from the **fuel** to the **coolant** by convection.
   * The coolant carries this heat away, just like in a real CANDU reactor.

   The rate of heat transfer and temperature change is calculated considering Newton's Law of Cooling

    ![Frame 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/909ff8b9-5593-4e0e-90dc-7f86aabf41f0)

   Equations are solved using `scipy.integrate.odeint`, which computes how temperatures evolve over time.

3. **Inputs / Constants**

   * `Q_fission`: Heat generated by fission (Watts = J/s).
   * `m_fuel`, `c_fuel`: Mass and specific heat of the fuel.
   * `h_conv`, `A_ht`: Convective heat transfer coefficient and heat transfer area.
   * `m_coolant`, `c_coolant`: Mass and specific heat of coolant.
   * `T_inlet`: Inlet temperature of the coolant.
   * `mdot_coolant`: Coolant mass flow rate.

4. **Simulation**

   * Initial temperatures are set for both fuel and coolant.
   * The program simulates over 1 hour (`t = np.linspace(0, 3600, 500)`).
   * Results are stored as arrays for fuel and coolant temperatures.

5. **GUI Visualization**

   * Built with **Tkinter**.
   * Displays a **background image** (e.g., diagram of a CANDU reactor).
   * Two text overlays show **fuel temperature** (red) and **coolant temperature** (blue).
   * Values update live every 200 ms.

6. **Graph Visualization**

   * A **Matplotlib graph** is embedded directly inside the Tkinter window.
   * It plots **fuel vs. coolant temperature** against time.
   * Graph updates in sync with the GUI, creating a smooth live simulation.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Save the code into a file, e.g., `reactor_cooling_sim.py`.
2. Place your background image (`candu_reactor.png`) inside an `images/` folder.
3. Run the program:

   ```bash
   python reactor_cooling_sim.py
   ```
4. A Tkinter window will open showing:

   * Background image of a reactor.
   * Fuel and coolant temperatures updating in real time.
   * A live Matplotlib graph embedded inside the GUI.

## üåü Why This is Exciting

This program gives you a **front-row seat** to the inner workings of a nuclear reactor ‚Äî safely, on your computer screen!

While real reactors involve extremely complex physics and safety systems, this simplified model captures the **essence of reactor cooling**: fuel gets hot, coolant takes the heat away, and stability is achieved through balance.

If you‚Äôve ever wondered *‚Äúwhat does a reactor actually do?‚Äù* ‚Äî this program makes that invisible process visible.
